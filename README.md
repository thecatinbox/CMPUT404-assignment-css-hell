How to apply CSS to the project gutenberg HTML files
====================
Step 1: Create styles.css in the same root folder as the html files. 

Step 2: Find the ```<head>``` tag in the html file. 

Step 3: Add ```link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">``` inside the ```<head>``` tag. Make sure it's after the ```<style>``` tag so it overwrites its original webpage styles. 

Step 4: Modify styles.css and you should see your changes.
